# NinjaVM
The **Ninja Virtual Machine** was created as an university project and is used to execute Ninja programs. Ninja is an acronym and stands for "Ninja is not Java". 
This project was part of a course called "Konzepte systemnaher Programmierung" which roughly translates to "Concepts of low-level programming". 

This repository has the sole purpose to preserve this project if all my drives were to die at the same time, because you need a special compiler, assembler and a small lib called bigint to translate ninja files to the .bin format this vm can execute and im not sure if im allowed to distribute these. However if you **really really** want to try out the NinjaVM there should be alot of similar repositories out there (since Im probably not the only one who took that course ^^) and one of them may provide the necessary tools and libraries to get this bad boy up and running.
